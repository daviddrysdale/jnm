Summary: Import Java classes and packages into Python
License: LGPL (version 3 or later)
Description: The javaclass collection of packages and utilities provides a means of importing
        Java classes and packages directly into Python, without the need for a Java
        virtual machine, so that the classes may be instantiated, accessed, run and
        manipulated just like Python classes, and that the resulting objects and methods
        can be accessed and manipulated just like Python objects and methods.
