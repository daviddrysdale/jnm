<h1>javaclass</h1>

<p>The javaclass collection of packages and utilities (also known as
ClassFile) provides a means of importing Java classes and packages directly
into Python, without the need for a Java virtual machine, so that the classes
may be instantiated, accessed, run and manipulated just like Python classes,
and that the resulting objects and methods can be accessed and manipulated
just like Python objects and methods. It should be possible to run compiled
Java programs with the Python interpreter and not notice that it isn't the
Java virtual machine being used - given sufficient library support for the
program concerned, of course.</p>

<h2>Quick Examples</h2>

<p>It can be quicker to see what this is about by seeing some examples.</p>

<h3>The Not Very Convincing Example</h3>

<p>You can run Java classes by finding one with a main method and executing
it. Here's a comparison of a freshly prepared Java class being run in Python
and in a Java virtual machine respectively:</p>
<pre class="Prompt">cd tests/</pre>
<pre class="Prompt">javac Value.java</pre>
<pre class="PromptRequest">runclass.py Value</pre>
<pre class="PromptResponse">v.getValue() correct: 123
v.getValue() correct: 456
v.isPositive() correct: 1
v.isPositive() correct: 0
v.compare(-790) correct: -1
v.compare(-788) correct: 1
v.compare(-789) correct: 0
v.getValue() == v2.getValue() correct: 0
v2.add(-123) correct: 0
v2.getValue() correct: 255</pre>
<pre class="PromptRequest">java Value</pre>
<pre class="PromptResponse">v.getValue() correct: 123
v.getValue() correct: 456
v.isPositive() correct: true
v.isPositive() correct: false
v.compare(-790) correct: -1
v.compare(-788) correct: 1
v.compare(-789) correct: 0
v.getValue() == v2.getValue() correct: false
v2.add(-123) correct: 0
v2.getValue() correct: 255</pre>

<h3>The Slightly More Credible Example</h3>

<p>It can be more interesting to get into Python's interactive mode and then
start playing around with Java classes:</p>
<pre class="PromptResponse">Python 2.2.2 (#2, Jan 21 2005, 16:16:57)
[GCC 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.3 2.96-112)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.</pre>
<pre class="PythonPrompt">import javaclass.classhook</pre>
<pre class="PythonPrompt">from __this__ import Value</pre>
<pre class="PythonPrompt">dir()</pre>
<pre class="PromptResponse">['Value', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__',
'javaclass']</pre>
<pre class="PythonPrompt">dir(Value)</pre>
<pre class="PromptResponse">['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__doc__',
'__getattribute__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init______I_', '__module__',
'__new__', '__reduce__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__str__', '__weakref__',
'add', 'add____I_', 'compare', 'compare____I_', 'getClass', 'getClass___',
'getValue', 'getValue___', 'isPositive', 'isPositive___', 'main',
'main___java__lang__String_array_', 'newValue', 'newValue___', 'setValue',
'setValue____I_']</pre>
<pre class="PythonPrompt">v = Value(20050121)</pre>
<pre class="PythonPrompt">v.getValue()</pre>
<pre class="PromptResponse">20050121</pre>
<pre class="PythonPrompt">v.setValue(20050401)</pre>
<pre class="PythonPrompt">v.getValue()</pre>
<pre class="PromptResponse">20050401</pre>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>See the <code>README.txt</code> file in the distribution directory.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Pick one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The need/desire to access Java libraries from Python without firing up
    Java virtual machines or switching to Jython (and thereby losing
    convenient access to various CPython libraries).</li>
  <li>Mixing languages available for the Java runtime with Python.</li>
  <li>Static typing for the Python environment, albeit achieved by writing
    Java or other appropriate languages.</li>
  <li>Having an open source environment from top to bottom to run Java
    bytecode on.</li>
  <li>Experimentation around import hooks, bytecode generation; observation
    of different runtime and type systems interacting.</li>
  <li>Making Python libraries available to Java programs - Tkinter for Java,
    anyone?!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>It isn't all great, however. Here are some reasons why this might not do
what you want it to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It runs on the Python runtime which does not have the security,
    threading and just-in-time compiler features that people enjoy about Java
    runtimes, so if what you like to do is to run one big servlet container
    with lots of classes and threads from different people floating around,
    this isn't going to protect them from doing all sorts of things to each
    other and to your system. However, you may take the unfashionable view
    that the operating system is supposed to do that kind of thing.</li>
  <li>It works by generating Python bytecode from the Java bytecode in class
    files (and .jar archives). Generally, anyone who is anyone in the Python
    pantheon has largely recommended against doing anything with the
    bytecode, despite noble efforts to make exciting things happen by
    transforming it, optimising it, and so on. (Instead, there's been more
    emphasis on lots of runtime baggage for things which could be done by
    analysis of the code with modified bytecode being produced as a result,
    and let's not get started on some of the syntax enhancements!)
    Consequently, stability might be an issue for some configurations,
    especially since CPython doesn't fail particularly graciously with badly
    behaved bytecode.</li>
  <li>Some of the translation from Java to Python bytecode takes a few
    liberties. For example, Java exceptions are handled in ways reminiscent
    of a 1980s microcomputer assembly language, whereas Python bytecode has
    higher level constructs for exceptions; this translation can probably be
    done incorrectly, triggering some kind of bytecode misbehaviour, and we
    all know what happens then.</li>
  <li>At the Python level, not all things seem totally right. For example,
    Java bytecode instructions are used to instantiate and then initialise
    exceptions just like other objects, and while Python can support this
    with new-style objects, Python won't let you use new-style objects as
    exceptions. Consequently, when Java exceptions appear in Python programs,
    they will be wrapped in old-style exceptions and have to be handled
    specially.</li>
  <li>In order to support method dispatch properly, special names are used
    for the translated methods which include the type information found in
    the bytecode; things like <code>main___java__lang__String_array_</code>
    and <code>setValue____I_</code> appear when you look inside classes and
    objects. When implementing libraries in Python for Java programs, such
    method naming conventions have to be used because the original code is
    very specific about which method is being invoked, and for specialised
    versions of <code>__init__</code> it becomes necessary to do a
    <code>setattr</code> to add such methods into classes because of various
    "name mangling" measures in the Python compilation process. Now, many
    people might start advocating decorators at this point, but not everyone
    is running the very latest stuff from python.org, and decorators won't
    help you target a specific specialised method anyway.</li>
  <li>Special dispatcher methods are often generated for the benefit of
    Python access to Java classes, even though such methods are not strictly
    necessary for the Java classes to work amongst themselves. Such methods
    are only generated when many methods of the same name reside in a given
    class, since where Java distinguishes between them on the basis of the
    signatures, Python permits only one method of a given name and needs
    additional logic to dispatch to the actual method implementations on the
    basis of the types of the incoming values. The implementation of the
    dispatcher method is naive and does not try to order the type checks and
    dispatches according to the specificity of the parameter types; thus, a
    more reliable but more verbose way of ensuring that the correct method in
    such cases is called from a Python program may be to use the special long
    method name (eg. <code>setValue____I_</code>).</li>
  <li>Imported and translated bytecode is not written out or cached. This
    means that a fair amount of work happens every time you need to import
    Java classes, although the generation of .pyc files could be introduced
    provided that it captured the slightly different import semantics of
    Java; for example, you can import classes belonging to a package from
    several places on the PYTHONPATH, and this is something that generally
    isn't allowed/supported with the classic Python module import
  mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Most Java programs need standard Java library (also known as the Java
    API) classes; indeed, with <code>java.lang.String</code> and seemingly
    <code>java.lang.StringBuffer</code> required just for the usage of
    strings, and with the classic <code>main</code> method having
    <code>String[]</code> in its signature, some kind of library
    implementation is obviously necessary. Whilst importing everything from
    the .jar files bundled with Sun's JRE might be tempting, there may be a
    certain amount of native calling going on in secret which would defeat
    this approach, and anyone seriously interested in running Java code in
    Python should really want to steer clear of such proprietary dependencies
    anyway. It could be possible to wrap and make use of GNU Classpath or
    some other open source Java API implementation, but the cleanest (but not
    necessarily the least time-consuming) approach is surely to implement the
    standard API classes in Python, and a package called <code>java</code> is
    included which contains some fairly quick and dirty implementations to
    get things working.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggestions for Python Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make the bytecode interpreter more robust when encountering badly
    behaved bytecode, consider bytecode verification and other exciting
    features.</li>
  <li>Allow new-style objects as exceptions. Actually, just do something
    about the whole old-style vs. new-style class thing!</li>
  <li>Allow possible optimisation for things like statically predetermined
    method calls. The debate about static typing intersects slightly with the
    need to define methods with parameters of particular types, but
    supporting Java-style method "coexistence" (or multimethods, or whatever
    the proper name is) would presumably involve doing lots of things to the
    language that were once thought to be highly un-Pythonic. Besides, the
    need to interoperate with statically typed languages shouldn't dictate
    the design of Python, especially if better type systems could be adopted
    instead, leaving the static typing glue for strictly special
  occasions.</li>
  <li>Not that threaded Java programs have been run on Python yet, but with
    Python's current threading architecture I'd expect some
  disappointment.</li>
